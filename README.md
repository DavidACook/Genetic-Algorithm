â€“
Getting Started
[Hand-in Deadline: November23rd 2017]
The  hand-in  for  the  assignment  is a  report  on  your  attempts  to  so
lve  a  set  of  classification problems as  effectively  as  possible  using  any  form  of  evolutiona
ry  intelligence  covered  in  the course, building  upon  your  own  genetic  algorithm  code  developed  in  the 
first  few lab  sessions.The idea is that you will experience a classification data mining 
problem first-hand and produce the sort of output you might find in a commercial environment.
